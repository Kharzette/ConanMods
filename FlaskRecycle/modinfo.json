If you are using CharEditLite the quiet ones are female 2, 3, and 8 and I just fixed the Silent option to be silent as well.\n\nI could do a setting to make it more or less vocal if people want.  Maybe choose a random moan for the voice sets that don't have one, or make them all drink silently etc?\n\n[b]Mod ID:  1877326722[/b]\n\nSource at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/Kharzette/ConanMods][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhass/github_desktop_notifications/master/res/icons/GitHub-Mark-Light-64px.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27670106][img]https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png[/img][/url]",
