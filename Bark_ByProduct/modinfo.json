	"changeNote": "Changed this to not modify the recipe table at all.  It now attaches a component to carpentry benches that listens on the item crafted event.  If it is shaped wood or insulated wood, it adds bark.\n\nAdded a UI for admins to adjust the amount of bark to spit out.  Should work with the mod control panel by hades, but need to test it a bit",
